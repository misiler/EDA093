---- GROUP ----

Group: A4

Johannes Arvidsson joharv@student.chalmers.se
Rasmus Söderström Olsson rasolss@student.chalmers.se

---- PRELIMINARIES ----

We used stackoverflow.com alot, mostly due our lack of programming skills 
within recursive functions and linked lists.

Row 383 - 416 in
https://github.com/jmreyes/simple-c-shell/blob/master/simple-c-shell.c 
helped us understand on how to use dups.


			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

34 hours each.

Yes, we know this is a lot, but we had to learn alot of programming throughout
since we chose the course whitout really fulfilling all requirements in programming.


>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

Johannes solved most of the tasks while Rasmus strugged with 
the pipes. After approximately 9 h each, all remaining hours where spent on the pipes together.



			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

Pipes was hard. Especially combined with recursion and the linked list.


>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Forking and piping.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

Piping could have gone much faster if a flow chart of the relationship between
parents, children and grand-children was avaiable.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

A flow chart to understand that some parts (i.e. the parent with the shell)
must not be recursively called.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

The specifications should be clearer, for example test with multiple pipes.

"are provided" differs quite a bit from "you should provide" in slide 11.

>> Any other comments?

Would have been great with a consulting session closer to the end. We weren't 
stuck in the beginning and therefore we had no questions.
